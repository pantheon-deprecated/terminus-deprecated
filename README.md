# Deprecated.

Do not install this software. Please use the successor [Pantheon CLI](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/cli) project.

You may still report critical issues if you are still using this tool for legacy reasons. We will do our best to keep it operational, but all Pantheon users are advised to upgrade ASAP.
