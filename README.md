terminus
========

A Drush-based CLI interface into the Pantheon core API via a pseudoproxy.

This is being developed initially to support some engineering and partner edge
cases (DevOps shops, Kalabox, proviso), but we hope to make it a solid tool for
all command-line and script-savvy developers.

If you'd like to write your own code using terminus as an example, other PHP
libraries can be used to make direct API calls.

See `drush help --filter=terminus` for a list of commands.

Requirements
============

* Drush 5 or higher - https://github.com/drush-ops/drush
* PHP 5.3 or higher with cURL

Quick Demo
==========

    git clone https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus.git $HOME/.drush/terminus
    # Clear drush's cache.
    drush cc drush
    # Authenticate.
    drush pantheon-auth
    # List all your sites.
    drush pantheon-sites
    # Download and replace pantheon.aliases.drushrc.php
    drush pantheon-aliases
    # Show all terminus commands.
    drush help --filter=terminus

Build a site on Pantheon with drush_make
========================================

    # Specify the site name...
    SITE_NAME=REPLACEME
    # And a description...
    SITE_DESC="Building a site with drush_make and terminus"
    # Authenticate.
    drush pauth YOUR@EMAIL.COM --password=TOOMANYSECRETS
    # Create the site using Drupal 7 (drops-7) as the base.
    drush psite-create $SITE_NAME --label="$SITE_DESC" --product=21e1fada-199c-492b-97bd-0b36b53a9da0
    # Update your aliases.
    drush paliases
    # Determine the site_uuid of the newly created site.
    SITE_UUID=$(drush psite-uuid $SITE_NAME)
    # Change the connection mode of the dev environment to SFTP.
    drush psite-cmode $SITE_UUID dev sftp
    # Use a public URL as the source for drush_make to download a few modules.
    drush -y @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev make --no-core https://raw.github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/master/demo.make
    # Install the site. Remember to grab the password, or use drush uli later.
    drush -y @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev si --site-name="$SITE_DESC" pantheon
    # Commit the changes.
    drush psite-commit $SITE_UUID dev --message="Base tools from drush_make"
    # Change the connection mode back to git.
    drush psite-cmode $SITE_UUID dev git
    # Disable unnecessary modules.
    drush -y @pantheon.$SITE_NAME.dev dis overlay comment rdf toolbar
    # Enable new modules.

- Site import
- Team management
- In-progress job status
- Websockets support for real-time status info?
- A "pantheon shell" option to keep you in context for interactive use
